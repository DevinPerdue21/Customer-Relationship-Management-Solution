This project involved creating a CRM solution for a company's proposed problem. It involved looking at a requirements document that had all the company's requirements. We were to address five of these distinct requirements and propose a solution for two of them with a visual representation. This also involved developing three test plans that you will incorporate to test your solution for three of the problems.
